# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
<img src = "figures/emergency.jpg?raw=true" >
In this project, data engineering skills are applied to analyze disaster data and build a model for an API that classifies real messages sent during disaster events. A machine learning pipeline for text processing and multi-output classification is developed to classify these events in order to send the messages to an appropriate emergency agency. Finally, a Flask application is designed to help an emergency worker to get classification results in multiple categories for a given message.

# Requirements

 * plotly==4.4.1
 * nltk==3.6.2
 * joblib==0.14.1
 * pandas==1.3.2
 * numpy==1.19.5

# Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
